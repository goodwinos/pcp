BCC eBPF PMDA
=============

This PMDA extracts live performance data from extended BPF (Berkeley
Packet Filter) programs by using the BCC (BPF Compiler Collection)
Python frontend.

pmdabcc itself provides no PCP metrics or BPF code; instead it loads
and acts as a bridge for any number of configured, separate PCP BCC
PMDA Python modules running BPF programs.  Existing BCC Python tools
and programs should be possible to be utilized with PCP BCC PMDA
modules with reasonable effort.

As a convenience, the initial version of the BCC PMDA includes some
sample eBPF programs generated by BCC tools, to quickly get you up
and running.  In a future release, these programs will be replaced
by direct invocation of bcc/tools scripts and the local copies here
will be removed from PCP - once a BCC release containing the --ebpf
option to the bcc-tools is available.

These convenience eBPF programs reside in the modules/ subdirectory
and are unchanged from the upstream BCC project.  As a result these
eBPF programs are available under the same license as BCC, not PCP:
