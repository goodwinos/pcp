.TH PMDABCC 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdabcc\f1 \- BCC PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpmdabcc\fP is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
extracts live performance data from extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)
programs by using BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) Python frontend.
.PP
\fBpmdabcc\fP itself provides no PCP metrics or BPF code;
instead it loads and acts as a bridge for any number of configured,
separate PCP BCC PMDA Python modules running BPF programs.
Existing BCC Python tools and programs should be possible to be utilized
with PCP BCC PMDA modules with reasonable effort.
.PP
See the BPF and BCC documentation for detailed description of both.
.PP
.SH INSTALLATION
\fBpmdabcc\fP reads a mandatory ini-style configuration file
.IP
.PD 0
.RS +4
.IP \(bu 2
.I \f(CW$PCP_PMDAS_DIR\fP/bcc/bcc.conf
.RE
.PD
.PP
This file contains in its \fB[pmda]\fP section values
for the following PMDA options:
.IP
.PD 0
.RS +4
.IP \(bu 2
modules
.IP \(bu
prefix
.RE
.PD
.PP
\fBpmdabcc\fP reads module-specific configuration for each module
listed in the comma-separated list of \fBmodules\fP (mandatory).
By default, all metrics from the modules will appear under the
\fIbcc\fP Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS) tree, \fBprefix\fP
(optional) can be used to change this generic prefix.
.PP
For each listed module a corresponding \fB[module]\fP section must
be defined containing at least the following options:
.IP
.PD 0
.RS +4
.IP \(bu 2
module
.IP \(bu
cluster
.RE
.PD
.PP
\fBmodule\fP defines the actual Python module file name to be loaded
during PMDA startup under the \fImodules\fP subdirectory of the PCP
BCC PMDA installation.
\fBcluster\fP specifies the cluster ID for the metrics provided by
the module under the PMNS path.
Optionally, \fBprefix\fP can be defined to override the
generic value described above.
All modules accept but not necessarily use the boolean \fBdebug\fP option.
.PP
Modules may also support additional module-specific configuration options,
refer to each module for their supported options.
.PP
Once the needed setup is ready, you can install the PMDA to load the
configured modules and the BPF programs they utilize.
To install, do the following as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bcc
# ./Install
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.sp 1
.RS +4
.ft B
.nf
# cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/bcc
# ./Remove
.fi
.ft P
.RE
.sp 1
\fBpmdabcc\fP is launched by \fBpmcd\fP(1) and should never be
executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify \fBpmcd\fP(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.
.SH FILES

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fP are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by PCP.
On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fP contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fP variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fBpcp.conf\fP(5).
